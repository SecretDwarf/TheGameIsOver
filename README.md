# Overview

Note: This project is still in development and is not complete. 

We created this project both for fun and to learn how to use Unity to develop games.

This project is a game that ties together classic games in a new way. We followed tutorials to learn the basic game structure of each game and then added our own logic and sprites. The game follows a llama as the protagonist, who must fight back alien invaders who are attacking the llama kingdom. Each mini-game in the overall game helps him get a little closer to realizing this goal!
